# Ottetto
After an initial stimulus, eight computational agents influence each other in eight solos, 28 duets, 56 trios, 70 quartets, 56 quintets, 28 sextets, eight septets, and one octet. Ottetto results from the author’s own software, written using the Dicy2 library (Nika, J., Muller, A., Borg, J., Ostrowski, M., & Assayag, G. Dicy2 for Max. IRCAM, 2022). It implements eight computational improvisation agents, whose base material consists of a series of recordings made by a human performer. This application responds with transformations of various moments selected through mimetic processes based on the material fed into it during live performance.

In this way, the performer’s response becomes a reaction to the modification of their own recent past—something humans do habitually, as Gabriel García Márquez reminds us in Living to Tell the Tale (2002): “Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to tell it.” Ottetto is one of its possible allegories. If in daily life our actions and decisions are responses to how we reinterpret our past, here, the computational agents and the guitarist collaborate in a similar process mediated by algorithms. This adds a layer of meaning where the agents act as representations of digital memory, constantly reinterpreting and transforming the previous material that the guitarist—a “conscious human being”—generated by creatively responding to close the loop. If they succeeded, or if, on the contrary, that very gesture set them on an infinite spiral, remains open. As Montale wrote in I miraggi (1971), “il tempo si ravvolge in sé stesso” (“time coils back on itself”). Ottetto is memory and narration, where the human and the artificial intertwine in a philosophical exploration rendered into music.
